Audio and visual practice videos done in Hydra and TidalCycles

The following performance videos are from the midterm and final performances from DM-UY 4913. 

The theme of the midterm performance was to simulate being in a restaurant. First, the appetizers (bass and percussion) was served.
The main course (a melody and more audio layering) soon followed. Finally, dessert (softer, concluding melody) was served.

The theme of the final performance was a "Winter Dreamland." Calming visuals depicting the winter scenery was layered on top of twinkling, dream-like
audio to simulate the act of going to bed on Christmas Eve and dreaming.
